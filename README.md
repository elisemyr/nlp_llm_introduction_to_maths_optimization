# Answers to Questions

# 2.3 Plot the graph of the function $f_1(x,\alpha .x)$ for $x \in [-3,3]$ and $\alpha \in \{ 1/\sqrt3, 1, \sqrt3 \}$. What do these graphs represent?
This graph represents the function f1 along lines going through the origin with different slopes.

# 3.1 In particular, what happens if the domain discretization is insufficient?
With not a few examples, the code cannot capture the shape of the function, contours can be shifted, curves can appear broken
Local minima or maxima
